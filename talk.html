  <h2> Mental Copacity For School </h2>
  <p> I don't know what it is about online school but ever since Covid-19 hit, my grades has been steadily dropping. I can probably assume that this is due to a communication problem. Afterall, teachers are less accessible than before as you can not meet with them face to face and have a clearer understanding of eachother. Other problems related to online school would be the neccessity of emails. Due to physical limitations, most of the information that needs to get to us is through the form of an email. If you were to miss even one important email, then you probably missed out on an opportunity or missed some sort of assignment. Afterall, I find it easier for me to have a physical copy of what all my homeworks are. I find it annoying that different teachers may use different platforms for submitting homework. It would all be easier if everyone stuck with one platform so that I would be able to better keep track of my resources and what I would need to do for homework.</p>

  <h2> Effect on Social and Mental Health </h2>
  <p> Similar to my complaint about not being able to go to school, I have rarely even seen my friends for over a year now. Due to quarantine, my ability to go outside has been severely limited compared to before then. Although I still talk to them, my environmental health has severely decreased as I've been stuck at home for far too long. Your environmental health has a huge impact on your mental health as it can correlate to you feeling more depressed due to unchanging circumstances. Socially, I've witnessed my friends becoming more and more depressed with nothing to do. For example, one of my friends has even gone so far as to need to talk with their parents about cutting him some slack due to his inability to continue doing work. He feels incredibly depressed and whenever he tries to do anything, he hits a mindblock extremely quickly. In his own words, he says that he can't not worry about work anymore. </p>

  <h2> Effect on Physical Health </h2>
  <p> Personally I feel as though my body is continuously deteriorating. Although I used to exercise somewhat frequently, I can no longer find the motivation to force myself to keep my body in better condition. The exercise I get from Physical Education class doesn't offset the amount of sitting around I do. Although you can argue that due to the pandemic, you get way more sleep due to having no commute neccessary, however, I can argue that due to students easily having poor time management, they would sleep less from not being able to complete all their work in a timely fashion. All of these reasons just goes to show that the pandemic not only limits your mental, social, and physical health but also forces bad habits such as having poor time management.</p>
